<p>At the moment Plitter dataset consists of images collected along roadside, some of them are besided by water canals. The data collected regions are along mekong river basin, and Pathumthani, Thailand.</p>

<h1> How we collects data</h1>
<p> 
    The data we collect is used to grow the pLitter dataset and heatmap the cities to analyse littering scenarios.
    To perform the data collection in large scale we capture videos of the streetsides using cameras mounting to sides of vehicles with camera facing to the direction of streetside we are targeting. 
    As GPS information is must needed for heatmaps, we enable GPS logging in the cameras (GoPro cameras support GPS logging with a satisfiable accuracy). Smart phone cameras also a good option data for collection.
    We recommend our volunteers who are using mobile phones to use the GPS logging enabled video recording applications to capture the videos of streetsides for pLitter heatmaps.
</p>
<p>
    We also recieve images captured from any kind of cameras which can capture images in a satisfiable pixel resolution. All the images which contains plastic litter are added into pLitter dataset for model improvement. If the images are geo-tagged we also use them in the pLitter maps.

<h1> How we pre-process the data</h1>
<p>
    We use the pLitter tool developed in python to pre-process the data (videos). We first convert the video to images by capturing the frames and geo-tag the images utilizing the GPS log (if available).
    The we let the existing up to date pLitter model to predict the plastic litter objects in the images. Then we use this image metadat of geo-tagged images and predictions to visualize the heatmap, and we export the images and predictions to annotation tool to make corrections such as shape and category adjustments.
</p>

<h1> How we annotate the images</h1>
<p>
    With every new incoming data, our team of annotators label the images. We use Coco-annotator to manage the annotation process. We are also taking help through Citizen Science approach to make the pLitter annotations better and to understand the citizens perspective on plastic litter items categorization.
