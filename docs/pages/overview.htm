<!-- <p>At the moment Plitter dataset consists of images collected along roadside, some of them are besided by water canals. The data collected regions are along mekong river basin, and Pathumthani, Thailand.</p>

<h1> How we collects data</h1>
<p> 
    The data we collect is used to grow the pLitter dataset and heatmap the city's to analyse littering scenarios. 
    To perform the data collection in large scale we capture videos of the streetsides using cameras mounting to sides of vehicles, camera direcion facing to the streetside targeting. 
    As GPS information is must needed for heatmaps, we enable GPS logging in thr cameras (GoPro cameras support GPS logging with a satisfiable accuracy). Nowadays smart phone cameras also a ggod option data collection.
    We recommend our volunteers who are using mobile phones to use the GPS logging enabled video recording applications to capture the videos of streetsides for pLitter heatmaps.

    We also recieve images captured from any cameras, all the images which contains plastic litter are added into pLitter dataset for model improvement. If the images are geo-tagged we use them in the pLitter maps.

<h1> How pre-process the data</h1>
<p>
    We use the tool developed in python to pre-process the data (videos). We first convert the video to images by capturing the frames and use the GPS log (if available) to geo-tag the images.
    The we let the existing up to date pLitter model to predict the plastic litter objects in the images. we use this geo-tagged images and predictions to visualize the heatmap, and we export the images and predictions to annotation tool to make corrections such as shape and category adjustments.
</p>

<h1> How data is annotated</h1>
<p>
    With every new incoming data, our team of annotators label the images. We use Coco-annotator to manage the annotation process. We are also taking help through Citizen Science approach to make the pLitter annotations better and to understand the citizens perspective on plastic litter items categorization.
